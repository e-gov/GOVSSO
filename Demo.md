# Demo

For demonstration and testing purposes, there are two publicly accessible deployments of [GovSSO example client](Example):

* [https://govsso-demo-client-a.id.ee/](https://govsso-demo-client-a.id.ee/)
* [https://govsso-demo-client-b.id.ee/](https://govsso-demo-client-b.id.ee/)

These example clients integrate with the GovSSO service's demo environment (`govsso-demo.ria.ee`) and demonstrate all flows that a GovSSO client must implement (authentication, session update, logout, and back-channel logout).
