# Example software for GovSSO client

Currently there is one example in Java for integrating with GovSSO. The example can be
found [here](https://github.com/e-gov/GOVSSO-Client/).

NB! Currently, this is a proof of concept implementation, not a reference implementation! Validations and checks are not
fully implemented yet! Example code and configuration in that repository cannot be used as a reference yet!
