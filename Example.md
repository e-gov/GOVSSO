# Example software for GovSSO client

Currently there is one example in Java for integrating with GovSSO. The example can be found [here](https://github.com/e-gov/GOVSSO-Client/).

Keep in mind that this is proof of concept implementation, not reference implementation! The example do not fully implement all needed checks!
